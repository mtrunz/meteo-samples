# RainViewer API Samples

The following files contain code samples to get you started using the [RainViewer API](https://www.rainviewer.com/api.html) on the following mapping platforms:

* [Google Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps)
* [Mapbox](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/)
* [OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org)
* [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com)
* [ESRI ArcGIS](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/)
* [HERE Maps](https://developer.here.com/develop/javascript-api)

For some of the mapping services you will need to signup for an API Key and place it in the code where it says **API KEY HERE**.

These samples only show the basics. Make sure you read the [RainViewer API](https://www.rainviewer.com/api.html) Documentation for all the possible options.
